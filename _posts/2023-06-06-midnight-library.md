> "Between life and death there is a library, and within that library, the shelves go on forever" 

This opened a doorway to contemplation. It reminded me of the boundless potential that exists within our own lives, waiting to be embraced. As I accompanied Nora through the Midnight Library, the wisdom of her experiences touched my heart.
